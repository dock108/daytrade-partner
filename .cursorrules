# AI Coding Rules

## Universal Standards

### Code Quality
- Write clear, self-documenting code. Comments explain WHY, not WHAT.
- Small, focused functions. One responsibility per function.
- No magic numbers or hardcoded strings—use constants.
- Fail fast. Validate inputs early, handle errors explicitly.
- No silent failures. Log or surface all errors.

### Change Philosophy
- Prefer minimal, incremental changes over rewrites.
- Don't refactor unrelated code while fixing bugs.
- If something works, don't "improve" it without reason.
- Leave code cleaner than you found it, but don't go overboard.

### Dependencies
- Don't add new dependencies casually.
- Justify any new package inline.
- Prefer standard library solutions when reasonable.

### Testing
- Add tests for new logic.
- If fixing a bug, add a regression test.
- Tests should be deterministic and fast.

### Documentation
- Update README if behavior changes.
- Add CHANGELOG entries for user-facing changes.
- Document breaking changes explicitly.

### What NOT to Do
- Don't over-engineer or over-abstract.
- Don't add features that weren't requested.
- Don't guess—ask or leave a TODO.
- Don't use print/console.log in production code.

## Tech Stack: Swift / SwiftUI (iOS)

### Architecture
- MVVM pattern: Views → ViewModels → Models/Services
- Views should not contain business logic
- ViewModels handle state and business logic
- Models are plain data structures (prefer structs)
- Services handle external concerns (network, persistence)

### Swift Conventions
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use `camelCase` for properties/functions, `PascalCase` for types
- Prefer `let` over `var`
- Use guard for early exits
- Avoid force unwrapping (!) without guard

### SwiftUI Practices
- Extract subviews when a view exceeds ~30 lines
- Use `@State` for view-local state, `@StateObject` for owned objects
- Support dark mode—use semantic colors
- Every view file should have a `#Preview`
- Use `.task` for async work, not `.onAppear` with Task

### File Structure
```
AppName/
├── Models/          # Data structures
├── Views/           # SwiftUI views
├── ViewModels/      # ObservableObject classes
├── Services/        # Network, persistence, utilities
└── Resources/       # Assets, localized strings
```

### Prohibited
- Force unwrapping without guard
- Empty catch blocks
- Business logic in Views
- Network calls without proper error handling
